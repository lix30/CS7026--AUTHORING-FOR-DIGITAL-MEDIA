                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The Marciana Library (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana) in Venice is one of the oldest and most important libraries in Italy, known for its vast collection of classical texts and stunning Renaissance architecture.</p>
                <p>Founded in the 16th century, it was envisioned as a grand repository for knowledge, fulfilling the wishes of Cardinal Bessarion, who donated his vast collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts to Venice in 1468. Construction began in 1537 under the renowned architect Jacopo Sansovino, and the library became a masterpiece of Venetian Renaissance design.</p>
                <p>Located in Piazza San Marco, near the Doge’s Palace, it houses rare manuscripts, ancient maps, and works by famous scholars. Over the centuries, it has been a center of learning and culture, preserving Venice’s intellectual heritage. Today, the Marciana Library remains a symbol of Venetian scholarship and artistic achievement.</p>

                    <p>The Marciana Library in Venice is a historical and architectural gem, but its age and location present some challenges for accessibility. Here's what you need to know:</p>
                    <p>Accessibility for Wheelchair Users</p>
                        <p>Entrance Ramp: The main entrance has a ramp that makes the library accessible for wheelchair users. However, the ground floor’s flooring may be uneven due to the building’s historical nature.</p>
                        <p>Interior Movement: The floors are often uneven, and some areas may be difficult to navigate, especially the monumental rooms, which feature intricate marble flooring. Staff are available to assist if needed.</p>
                    <p>Navigating the Library</p>
                        <p>While the ground floor and the first-floor rooms are generally accessible, the second floor and higher levels have narrow stairs and are not equipped with elevators.
                            Access to the reading rooms and archives on higher levels is typically restricted to researchers or staff, and those areas are not wheelchair accessible.</p>
                    <p>Visiting Tips for Accessibility</p>
                        <p>Assistance: Staff are usually available to help visitors who require assistance, especially if there are mobility challenges. It's best to ask for help at the information desk.</p>
                        <p>Best Time to Visit: For a more comfortable visit, consider coming early in the day when the library is less crowded.</p>
