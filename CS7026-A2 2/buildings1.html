                <h2>A Fortress of Political Might</h2>
                <p>The Doge’s Palace (Palazzo Ducale) is the embodiment of Venice’s power, both political and economic. </p>
                <p>For centuries, it was the seat of the Doge, the elected ruler of Venice, and the home of the Venetian government.</p>
                <p>It also housed the council chambers, the court of justice, and even the prisons for those who opposed the Republic.</p>

                <p><ul>
                    <li><strong>Marino Faliero (1355):</strong> The only Doge executed for treason—his portrait was erased from the palace’s gallery in shame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Francesco Foscari (1457):</strong> Forced to resign after his son was accused of treason. His downfall happened within the very walls of the palace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enrico Dandolo (1192-1205):</strong> The blind but ruthless Doge who orchestrated the sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. His bold strategies expanded Venice’s influence but left a legacy of destruction.</li>
