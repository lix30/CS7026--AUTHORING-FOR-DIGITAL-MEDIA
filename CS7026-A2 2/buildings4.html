                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>St. Mark's Basilica (Basilica di San Marco) in Venice is one of the most iconic churches in the world, known for its stunning Italo-Byzantine architecture and rich history. Originally built in 828 AD, it was meant to house the stolen relics of Saint Mark, the patron saint of Venice, which were smuggled from Alexandria by Venetian merchants. The basilica was rebuilt in its current form in 1063, reflecting Venice’s growing power and wealth.</p>
                <p>Over the centuries, it has been adorned with golden mosaics, intricate marble facades, and treasures looted from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade (1204), including the famous four bronze horses above the entrance. Once the private chapel of the Doge, it became the city’s cathedral in 1807. Today, St. Mark’s Basilica remains a breathtaking symbol of Venice’s maritime and artistic legacy, attracting millions of visitors each year.</p>

                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <p>Stolen Relics – The basilica was built to house the relics of Saint Mark, which were allegedly smuggled out of Alexandria, Egypt, in 828 AD by Venetian merchants. They reportedly hid the saint’s remains under layers of pork to avoid Muslim customs officers.</p>
                <p>Golden Basilica – It is often called the "Church of Gold" (Chiesa d'Oro) due to its lavish gold mosaics, which cover over 8,000 square meters of the interior.</p>
                <p>Looted Treasures – Many of its decorations, including the four bronze horses above the main entrance, were taken from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The original horses are now kept inside the basilica to protect them from weather damage.</p>
                <p>Hidden Architectural Mix – While it is mainly Byzantine in style, the basilica also features Gothic, Renaissance, and Islamic influences, showcasing Venice’s history as a major trading hub between East and West.</p>
                <p>Secret Doge’s Chapel – Before becoming Venice’s official cathedral in 1807, it was the private chapel of the Doge, the ruler of the Venetian Republic.</p>

                <h2>Characters</h2>
                <p>St. Mark’s Basilica has been home to and influenced by several important figures throughout history.</p>
                <p>The Doges of Venice</p>
                <p>For centuries, St. Mark’s Basilica was the private chapel of the Doge, the ruler of Venice. It wasn’t until 1807 that it officially became the city's cathedral.
                    The Doges were often buried in the basilica or nearby in the Doge’s Palace.</p>
                <p>Saint Mark the Evangelist</p>
                <p>The basilica was built to house the stolen relics of Saint Mark, one of the four Gospel writers.
                    According to legend, when Venice lost track of the relics in the 11th century, they miraculously reappeared inside a pillar during renovations.</p>
                <p>Crusaders and Conquerors</p>
                <p>In 1204, during the Fourth Crusade, Venetian-led forces sacked Constantinople and brought back treasures, including the famous Horses of St. Mark and parts of the church’s golden decorations.
                    Venetian merchants and military leaders played a key role in this looting, enriching the basilica.</p>
                <p>Architects & Artists</p>
                <p>Over the centuries, numerous architects and craftsmen contributed to its unique mix of Byzantine, Gothic, and Renaissance styles.
                    The lavish gold mosaics were designed by Venetian and Greek artists, and some were even later restored by Titian and Tintoretto, two of Venice’s greatest painters.</p>
                <p>Napoleon Bonaparte</p>
                <p>n 1797, Napoleon invaded Venice, abolished the Venetian Republic, and looted many of its treasures, including the Golden Altar (Pala d’Oro), parts of which were later returned.
                    In 1807, he made St. Mark’s the official cathedral of Venice, ending its status as the Doge’s private chapel.</p>
